Einstein said: _"If you can't **explain it simply**, you don't **understand it well enough**"_. He was also an excellent writer, I think (well, his explanation about Theory of Relativity is quite simple, I always have that feeling whenever I read it, although till now I can't understand it completely :D ).  
  
  Nowadays, we are living in an ocean with vast of contious flows of updated knowledges, appeared and disappeared trends, market changes that lead to changes in our job, etc ... As Hecralitus said, _"Everything flows and nothing stays"_, what we learned would be outdated, our jobs would lost, etc... And futurist and philosopher Alvin Toffler once wrote: _"The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot **learn, unlearn, and relearn**."_ Act or be acted, it's our choice.  
  
  Well, it's enough for quotes. I have spent lot of time in learning, from various sources, Coursera, Udacity, M.S courses, meetings, conferences, etc... and my course list seems never end. After all, I realized that the time in which I learned most effectively and quantitively was the time I followed these steps strictly: learning, practising and **writing**. The final one, writing, **helped me** review knowledge and make me **confident in my understanding**. It likes you can sleep well tonight after finishing all works and planing all for tomorrow. It liked **I can** **securely close a door** in my brain and ready to open a new door to get new thing, freely and freshly. The procastination seemed never take place.
