**_What is my real name?_**

### More Information
I get bored talking about myself. It makes me recall to a novel, Eragon (Christopher Paolini) in that everything has a real name and most of them don't know it. But I can talk about the projects and knowledges. Not all of them are used in my job and some of them seem crazy. Well, I always learn new stuffs and try to find some things to apply them.
